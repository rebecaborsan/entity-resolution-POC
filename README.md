# Entity Resolution POC 

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Proof of Concept for resolving supplier entities using structured matching and data quality techniques.

## Dataset
A client-provided sample of supplier companies enriched with candidate matches generated by an entity resolution engine.

## Approach
- Location-based validation (country, region, city)
- Keyword matching on company names and website domains
- Semantic validation using long company descriptions
- Group-level filtering to avoid eliminating valid matches
- High-confidence candidate classification

## Output
The final result is a high-confidence set of resolved supplier candidates, exported as a CSV file and ready for downstream consumption.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
